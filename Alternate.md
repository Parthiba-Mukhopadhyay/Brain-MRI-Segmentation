# Problem definiton
**Segmentation of gliomas in pre-operative MRI scans.**

*Each pixel on image must be labeled:*
* Pixel is part of a tumor area (1 or 2 or 3) -> can be one of multiple classes / sub-regions
* Anything else -> pixel is not on a tumor region (0)

The sub-regions of tumor considered for evaluation are: 1) the "enhancing tumor" (ET), 2) the "tumor core" (TC), and 3) the "whole tumor" (WT)
The provided segmentation labels have values of 1 for NCR & NET, 2 for ED, 4 for ET, and 0 for everything else.
