# Brain MRI Segmentation

## Dataset

**Dataset Used:** [Kaggle LGG MRI Segmentation (3M)](https://www.kaggle.com/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)

### About the Dataset
- The dataset contains brain MRI images along with manual FLAIR (Fluid-attenuated Inversion Recovery) abnormality segmentation masks.
- It provides pixel-level classification of abnormal regions within the brain MRI images.
- Organized in subsets, each containing exactly 5 cases or 5 patients' data, with a total of 22 subsets.
- Includes both tumor and normal brain MRI images.
- Tumor images may contain various types such as Glioma, Metastatic adenocarcinoma, Metastatic bronchogenic carcinoma, Meningioma, and Sarcoma.

## Libraries Used

- **NPP (Neural Pre Processing):** End-to-end weakly supervised learning approach for converting raw head MRI images to intensity-normalized, skull-stripped brains in a standard coordinate space.
- **Nilearn:** Enables approachable and versatile analyses of brain volumes, supporting GLM-based analysis and leveraging scikit-learn for multivariate statistics.
- **Nibabel:** Python library providing read and write access to common medical and neuroimaging file formats.
- **TorchIO:** Open-source Python library for efficient loading, preprocessing, augmentation, and patch-based sampling of 3D medical images in deep learning, following the design of PyTorch.
- **Einops:** Python library used to manipulate tensors (multidimensional arrays) in ML models.
- **Surfa:** Collection of Python utilities for medical image analysis and mesh-based surface processing.
- **PyTorch Lightning:** Lightweight PyTorch wrapper for high-performance AI research, aiming to scale models, not the boilerplate.
- **Skull Stripping:** Open-source library, part of PyTorch Lightning, for preparing skull stripping methods on T1 sequence head MRI images.
- **Argparse:** Module for creating programs in a command-line environment.
- **Itertools:** Module implementing iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML.
- **Shutil, Glob:** Libraries for file handling and manipulation.
- **Seaborn, Matplotlib:** Libraries for visualization and graphical representation.
- **Tqdm:** Library for animated loading and processing sections.
- **TensorFlow, Scikit-image, NumPy, Pandas:** Predefined libraries for image processing and data manipulation.
